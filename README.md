We ran a questionnaire on the visualisation of trend figures.
First we ask the participant to interpret a few simple trend figures consisting of solely a trend line.
Next we gave them a few options to improve the trend figure.
1) percentage change instead of an index number.
2) adding reference lines indicating the size of an important effect.
3) adding confidence intervals.
4) adding a symbol with classification of the change.
Finally we asked the participate again to interpret a few trend figures, now based on their preferences.
